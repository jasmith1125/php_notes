//can't use echo to print array; use print_r

//example:

$characters = ["Popeye", "Brutus", "Olive Oyl"];
print_r($characters);

//to display second element in above array:

echo $characters(1); //indexed from 0


//to add elements to existing array:

$characters[] = "Sweetpea";

//this is example of indexed array; indexed from 0
